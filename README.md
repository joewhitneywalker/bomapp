# bomapp ðŸ§¾

------------------------------
**bomapp is a web based BOM (Bill Of Materials) application. This application is used to manage singular components that make up physical products. Each physical product designer lists components into their BOM shell and assign article codes, colors, and quantities to each component. This is then passed off to a factory of a reciept and instruction manual that lists each component needed for the said physical product.**

ABOUT:
THE PROBLEM:
THIS APPLICATION WAS CREATED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. CURRENTLY, THE BOM APP I USE FOR WORK IS NOT USER FRIENDLY. THE FILEDS RENDER VERTICALLY RATHER THAN HORIZONTALLY, AND DO NOT CLEARLY CALL OUT WHICH SECTION THE USER IS ON. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS NOT IMAGE FIELD TO REFERENCE YOUR TECHNICAL SKETCH. I SEE THE POTENTIAL HERE TO MAKE BETTER USE OF INFORMATIONAL AND VISUAL ARCHITECTURE TO CREATE AN APP THAT IS MORE USER CENTRIC. 

THE SOLVE:
I AM PROPOSING TO UPDATE OUR CURRENT APPLICATION WITH A NEW LAYOUT AND SOME ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY SUCH AS RECENT FILES LIST, SKETCH VIEW AND IMAGE VIEW FOR EACH COMPONENT. THIS WILL ADD MORE VISUAL REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE BOM APP AND REDUCE MISCOMMUNICATION.
