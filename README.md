# bomapp ðŸ§¾

------------------------------
**bomapp is a web based BOM (Bill Of Materials) application. This is a simple application that is used to outline the make up of physical products (such as clothing) including fabrics, trims and labels. Each designer is responsible for creating BOMs to hand off to vendors that need to communicate how what is being used, the color, the quantity and placement. Additionally, this application has visual references for the designer's sketch, the fabric, trim and material to increase BOM accuracy. Each style is searchable by it's style number and each BOM and component in the BOM can be easily updated.**

ABOUT:
THE PROBLEM:
THIS APPLICATION WAS CREATED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. CURRENTLY, THE BOM APP I USE FOR WORK IS NOT USER FRIENDLY. THE FILEDS RENDER VERTICALLY RATHER THAN HORIZONTALLY, AND DO NOT CLEARLY CALL OUT WHICH SECTION THE USER IS ON. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS NOT IMAGE FIELD TO REFERENCE YOUR TECHNICAL SKETCH. I SEE THE POTENTIAL HERE TO MAKE BETTER USE OF INFORMATIONAL AND VISUAL ARCHITECTURE TO CREATE AN APP THAT IS MORE USER CENTRIC. 

THE SOLVE:
I AM PROPOSING TO UPDATE OUR CURRENT APPLICATION WITH A NEW LAYOUT AND SOME ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY SUCH AS RECENT FILES LIST, SKETCH VIEW AND IMAGE VIEW FOR EACH COMPONENT. THIS WILL ADD MORE VISUAL REPRESENTATION WITHIN THE BOM APP AND REDUCE MISCOMMUNICATION.

--------------------------------

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
1. ADD A "COPY BOM" FEATURE, SO THE USER CAN CREATE ONE BASE BOM & COPY AS A TEMPLATE
2. VISUALLY RENDER OUT COLORS IN THE BOM LIST VIEW
3. UPDATE FUNCTIONALITY TO ALLOW FOR MULTIPLE COLORS IN A SINGLE BOM - TIED TO A SPECIFIC FABRIC BASE
4. ADD A SEASONL WORKSPACE WHERE THE USER CAN FILTER BY SEASON OR CATEGORY
